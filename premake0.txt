premake4 must be deprecated but was used for the travis ci linux build machines despite glob issues.
glob issues make it so that if a folder is excluded then children could not be added in selectively.
the issue should be reproducible on all three platforms but i only saw it on mac and linux in repro.

premake5 bugs are blocking the upgrade. clean operation is missing and excludes directive is broken.
meanwhile generate vs 2012 project. then within the solution right click upgrade to vs 2013 version.
to build premake4 and premake5 get the premake-4.x and premake-core with git clone --recursive path.
then use old executables to generate project files after running the premake embed cmd to bootstrap.
premake-5.0.0-alpha13 has both changes below so all binaries have been updated to that version here.
https://github.com/premake/premake-core/pull/344 & https://github.com/premake/premake-xcode/pull/22.

premake5 or clang has a bug where if similarly named files exist under diff directories builds fail.
as a work around for now use ifdef define endif header guards while avoiding pragma once for safety.

download sha https://downgit.github.io and versions of premake everywhere are premake-5.0.0-alpha15.
